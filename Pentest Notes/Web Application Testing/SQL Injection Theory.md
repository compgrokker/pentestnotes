meddle with sql queries between web app and database

extend query to db tables that are normally inaccessible

frontend UI interacts with backend framework interacts with DB

````
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name='leon'
````

becomes 

```
<?php
$uname = $_POST['uname'];
$passwd =$_POST['password'];

$sql_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name= '$uname' AND password='$passwd'";
$result = mysqli_query($con, $sql_query);
?>
```

lack of special character filtering is usually the culprit in SQLi

**MYSQL**

mysql server default port 3306
select version(); to get mysql version
select system_user(); get the user+hostname the current session we're using is running as
show databases; 
SELECT user, authentication_string FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'offsec';

mysql now uses a SHA-256 hashed password hash for security, authentication_string

**MSSQL**

native db for Windows
built-in cli tool called SQLCMD

use impacket to access on kali, impacket supports Tabular Data Stream in impacket-mssqlclient
impacket-mssqlclient Administrator:Lab123@192.168.50.18 -windows-auth

SELECT @@version;
SELECT name FROM sys.databases;
SELECT * FROM offsec.information_schema.tables;
select * from offsec.dbo.users; <= specifying 'dbo' schema between database and table names required
