1. vulns allowing us to upload executables to web apps
2. vulns that require us to combine file upload with something else like directory traversal or xss.  ex.: using avatar upload that allows svg to embed an xxe attack
3. vulns that rely on user interaction. ex.: job app that lets us upload a .docx with malicious macros, which attacks when file is interacted with by a user (ie HR)

#3 is out of scope for PEN-200

try less commonly used file extensions to bypass filtering/blacklisting, ie .phps and .php7
also try capitalizing some letters in extension, ie .pHP to see if filter is case-sensitive.
