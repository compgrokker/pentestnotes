LFI is including files as part of an app's running code
not to be confused with Directory Traversal-- DT == *displaying* files, LFI == *executing* files

log poisoning: include executable code in log files

Â In an LFI vulnerability scenario, the local file we include is executed if it contains executable content. This means that if we manage to write executable code to a file and include it within the running code, it will be executed.

insert ```
<?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>```
