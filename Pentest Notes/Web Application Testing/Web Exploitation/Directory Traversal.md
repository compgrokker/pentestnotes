absolute paths start at / 
relative paths are based off pwd, and are easy to spot by starting with .. rather than /

old-school method of just appending "../../../../../../etc/passwd" (or whatever) to the url in the browser bar doesn't work anymore in 99.99999% of sites unless they're totally fubar

if url is form of "http://somesite.com/index.php?page=farts.php" try substituting something else for "page=" like "page=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd"

you can use a ridiculous number of ../'s to get to root, once / is reached number of ../'s doesn't matter

curl will give better output of files than the browser will, as will burp.  browser tries to do fancy formatting

Windows IIS will use \\ instead of / for directory traversal attacks, contrary to RFC 1738

Reviewing the Microsoft documentation,[6](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/common-web-application-attacks-44643/directory-traversal-44690/identifying-and-exploiting-directory-traversals-44650#fn-local_id_556-6) we learn that the logs are located at **C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\**  . Another file we should always check when the target is running an IIS web server is **C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\web.config** , which may contain sensitive information like passwords or usernames.

URL encoding  (aka percent encoding) can get ../'s past WAFs.  .== %2e
