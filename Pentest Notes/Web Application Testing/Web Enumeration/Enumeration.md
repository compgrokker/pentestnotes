brute force directory enumeration with gobuster
gobuster is noisy, use with caution
gobuster also supports other modes like fuzzing and dns; 'dir' is mode to enumerate dirs
gobuster dir -u <ip> -w <wordlist> -t <threads>
default number of threads is 10; set lower with -t to be quieter
appropriate wordlists in /usr/share/wordlists/dirb

QUIET FIREFOX INFO:
Why does "detectportal.firefox.com" keep showing up in the proxy history? A _captive portal_[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/introduction-to-web-application-attacks-44516/web-application-assessment-tools-44556/security-testing-with-burp-suite-44520#fn-local_id_641-3) is a web page that serves as a sort of gateway page when attempting to browse the Internet. It is often displayed when accepting a user agreement or authenticating through a browser to a Wi-Fi network. To ignore this, simply enter **about:config** in the address bar. Firefox will present a warning, but we can proceed by clicking _I accept the risk!_. Finally, search for "network.captive-portal-service.enabled" and double-click it to change the value to "false". This will prevent these messages from appearing in the proxy history.
