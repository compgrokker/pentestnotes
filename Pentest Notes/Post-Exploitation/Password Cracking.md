`hashid` and `hash-identifier` are scripts included in Kali for finding out which type a hash is.
`hash-identifier` wants the hash pasted in, but gives better/simpler guesses
`hashid` can read a hash from a file, but has more complicated output and is less accurate, but sometimes knows a hash type that `hash-identifier` doesn't
