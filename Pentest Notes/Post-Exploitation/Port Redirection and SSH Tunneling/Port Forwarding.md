## Socat
`socat -ddd TCP-LISTEN:2345,fork TCP:10.4.50.215:5432`
---ddd is verbose
fork means fork into new subprocess upon connection instead of dying

## Other methods
It should also be noted that Socat is not the only way to create port forwards on *NIX hosts. There are several alternatives, of note:

- _rinetd_[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/port-redirection-and-ssh-tunneling-48849/port-forwarding-with-linux-tools-48918/port-forwarding-with-socat-48850#fn-local_id_38-3) is an option that runs as a daemon. This makes it a better solution for longer-term port forwarding configurations, but is slightly unwieldy for temporary port forwarding solutions.
    
- We can combine Netcat and a _FIFO_[4](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/port-redirection-and-ssh-tunneling-48849/port-forwarding-with-linux-tools-48918/port-forwarding-with-socat-48850#fn-local_id_38-4) named pipe file to create a port forward.[5](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/port-redirection-and-ssh-tunneling-48849/port-forwarding-with-linux-tools-48918/port-forwarding-with-socat-48850#fn-local_id_38-5)
    
- If we have root privileges, we could use iptables to create port forwards. The specific iptables port forwarding setup for a given host will likely depend on the configuration already in place. To be able to forward packets in Linux also requires enabling forwarding on the interface we want to forward on by writing "1" to **/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/[interface]/forwarding** (if it's not already configured to allow it).
