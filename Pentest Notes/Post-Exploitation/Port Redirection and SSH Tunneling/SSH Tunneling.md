with socat port forwarding, the listener and forwarder were the same host.  ssh local port forwarding is different.

With SSH local port forwarding, packets are not forwarded by the same host that listens for packets. Instead, an SSH connection is made between two hosts (an SSH client and an SSH server), a listening port is opened by the _SSH client_, and all packets received on this port are _tunneled through the SSH connection_ to the _SSH server_. The packets are then forwarded by the SSH server to the socket we specify.
