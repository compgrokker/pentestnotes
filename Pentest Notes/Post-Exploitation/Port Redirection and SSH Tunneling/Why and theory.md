### Port forwarding
flat networks aren't secure.  Secure networks should be segmented into subnets

pivoting is easy in flat networks and harder in segmented networks

firewalls are usually part of segmentation implementation.  linux iptables, windows defender firewall, or hardware firewall device

port redirection/forwarding and tunneling traverse network boundaries
Port redirection means modifying the flow of data so that packets sent to one _socket_ will be taken and passed to another socket. Tunneling means _encapsulating_[10](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/port-redirection-and-ssh-tunneling-48849/why-port-redirection-and-tunneling%3F-48919/why-port-redirection-and-tunneling%3F-48927#fn-local_id_3-10) one type of data stream within another, for example, transporting _Hypertext Transfer Protocol_ (HTTP) traffic within a _Secure Shell_ (SSH) connection (so from an external perspective, only the SSH traffic will be visible).

### Tunneling
At a high-level, _tunneling_ describes the act of encapsulating one kind of data stream within another as it travels across a network. Certain protocols called _tunneling protocols_[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/port-redirection-and-ssh-tunneling-48849/ssh-tunneling-48917/ssh-tunneling-48933#fn-local_id_11-1) are designed specifically to do this. _Secure Shell_ (SSH)[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/port-redirection-and-ssh-tunneling-48849/ssh-tunneling-48917/ssh-tunneling-48933#fn-local_id_11-2) is an example of one of these protocols.[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/port-redirection-and-ssh-tunneling-48849/ssh-tunneling-48917/ssh-tunneling-48933#fn-local_id_11-3)

SSH is encrypted successor to rsh, rlogin, and telnet.

In the background of each SSH connection, all shell commands, passwords, and data are transported through an encrypted tunnel built using the SSH protocol. The SSH protocol is primarily a tunneling protocol, so it's possible to pass almost any kind of data through an SSH connection. For that reason, tunneling capabilities are built into most SSH tools.

SSH is also normal network traffic and blends in.  Native tools on all 3 main platforms.
