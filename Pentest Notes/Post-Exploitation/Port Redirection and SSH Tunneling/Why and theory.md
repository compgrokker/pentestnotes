flat networks aren't secure.  Secure networks should be segmented into subnets

pivoting is easy in flat networks and harder in segmented networks

firewalls are usually part of segmentation implementation.  linux iptables, windows defender firewall, or hardware firewall device

port redirection/forwarding and tunneling traverse network boundaries
Port redirection means modifying the flow of data so that packets sent to one _socket_ will be taken and passed to another socket. Tunneling means _encapsulating_[10](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/port-redirection-and-ssh-tunneling-48849/why-port-redirection-and-tunneling%3F-48919/why-port-redirection-and-tunneling%3F-48927#fn-local_id_3-10) one type of data stream within another, for example, transporting _Hypertext Transfer Protocol_ (HTTP) traffic within a _Secure Shell_ (SSH) connection (so from an external perspective, only the SSH traffic will be visible).
