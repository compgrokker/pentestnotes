promiscuous mode to gather all traffic on network passing by attacker

arp poisoning to spoof switch

tcpdump -A -i <iface> -w /tmp/tcpdump.pcap

_**tl;dr –** "an attacker sends (spoofed) ARP messages […] to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host […] causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead. ARP spoofing may allow an attacker to **intercept** data frames on a network, **modify** the traffic, or stop all traffic. Often the attack is used as an opening for other attacks, such as denial of service, **man in the middle**, or session hijacking attacks."_ _-_ [_Wikipedia - ARP spoofing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing)
