inspect metadata tags in publicly available documents

use google dorking or gobuster website enumeration to gather docs

use exiftool to view metadata of supported files

exiftool -a -u <file>

use harvested names for name-dropping during social engineering to build a trust relationship

note any technology clues, like a tag that a file was created with MS Office without "for Mac", so Windows with MS Office installed
