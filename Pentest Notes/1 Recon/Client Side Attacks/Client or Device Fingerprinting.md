for finding info about non-routable endpoints that have been discovered

**CanaryToken**
 use _Canarytokens_,[5](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/client-side-attacks-48976/target-reconnaissance-49007/client-fingerprinting-48977#fn-local_id_339-5) a free web service that generates a link with an embedded token that we'll send to the target. When the target opens the link in a browser, we will get information about their browser, IP address, and operating system.

Before we create our tracking link, let's briefly discuss _pretexts_[6](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/client-side-attacks-48976/target-reconnaissance-49007/client-fingerprinting-48977#fn-local_id_339-6) we can use in a situation like this. A pretext frames a situation in a specific way. In a majority of situations, we can't just ask the target (a stranger) to click a link in an arbitrary email. Therefore, we should try to create context, perhaps by leveraging the target's job role.

Canarytoken will get us the info to know if we can do things like an HTML Application (HTA) attached to an email to execute code in IE/Edge that won't work in other browsers or on other OSs.

canarytoken uses javascript fingerprinting code rather than user agent to ID browser
