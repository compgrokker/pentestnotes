AV/EDR landscape is constantly changing, and AV evasion and obfuscation is constantly evolving in response.  No such thing as a one-size-fits-all technique.

signature based compares code against known fingerprints of malware/exploits
still in use because it still works, it's just not sufficiently effective on its own

heuristic-based detection relies on rules and looks  for code patterns

behavior-based detection relies on identifying malware by monitoring its behavior (newest type of detection, effective against newest malware (like polymorphic))

on-disk evasion techniques
- obfuscation - conceals code to make it harder to analyze or RE
- encoding 
- packing - new binary structure with smaller size, creating new signature
- crypters - encryption

in-memory evasion techniques
- focuses on manipulation of memory
- injects payload into running executables

**Shellter**
dynamic shellcode injection tool, first true dynamic PE infector

compatible with XP SP3 and above
runs with Wine in Linux

stealth mode means the infected exe still functions normally

**Invoke-Obfuscation**
compatible with powershell v2.0+

will run with powershell linux 

`Import-Module Invoke-Obfuscation.psd1`
