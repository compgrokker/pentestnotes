### NTLM Cracking

NTLM is only for local Windows accounts, not  AD.

Windows stores hashed user passwords in the _Security Account Manager_ (SAM)[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/password-attacks-44959/working-with-password-hashes-45019/cracking-ntlm-44965#fn-local_id_46-1) database file, which is used to authenticate local or remote users.

To deter offline SAM database password attacks, Microsoft introduced the _SYSKEY_ feature in Windows NT 4.0 SP3, which partially encrypts the SAM file. The passwords can be stored in two different hash formats: _LAN Manager_ (LM)[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/password-attacks-44959/working-with-password-hashes-45019/cracking-ntlm-44965#fn-local_id_46-2) and NTLM. LM is based on _DES_,[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/password-attacks-44959/working-with-password-hashes-45019/cracking-ntlm-44965#fn-local_id_46-3) and is known to be very weak. For example, passwords are case insensitive and cannot exceed fourteen characters. If a password exceeds seven characters, it is split into two strings, each hashed separately. LM is disabled by default beginning with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

NTLM hashes are now used.  case-sensitive, no longer split.  But still not salted.  Lack of salt opens up NTLM to rainbow table attack.

We cannot just copy, rename, or move the SAM database from `C:\Windows\system32\config\sam` while the Windows operating system is running because the kernel keeps an exclusive file system lock on the file.

Mimikatz also includes the _sekurlsa_ module, which extracts password hashes from the _Local Security Authority Subsystem_ (LSASS)[8](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/password-attacks-44959/working-with-password-hashes-45019/cracking-ntlm-44965#fn-local_id_46-8) process memory. LSASS is a process in Windows that handles user authentication, password changes, and _access token_[9](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/password-attacks-44959/working-with-password-hashes-45019/cracking-ntlm-44965#fn-local_id_46-9) creation.

LSASS runs under the SYSTEM user and is therefore even more privileged than a process started as Administrator.

Due to this, we can only extract passwords if we are running Mimikatz as Administrator (or higher) and have the _SeDebugPrivilege_[10](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/password-attacks-44959/working-with-password-hashes-45019/cracking-ntlm-44965#fn-local_id_46-10) access right enabled. This access right grants us the ability to debug not only processes we own, but also all other users' processes.

We can also elevate our privileges to the _SYSTEM_ account with tools like _PsExec_[11](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/password-attacks-44959/working-with-password-hashes-45019/cracking-ntlm-44965#fn-local_id_46-11) or the built-in Mimikatz _token elevation function_[12](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/password-attacks-44959/working-with-password-hashes-45019/cracking-ntlm-44965#fn-local_id_46-12) to obtain the required privileges. The token elevation function requires the _SeImpersonatePrivilege_[13](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/password-attacks-44959/working-with-password-hashes-45019/cracking-ntlm-44965#fn-local_id_46-13) access right to work, but all local administrators have it by default.

### NTLM Passing

Pass the Hash
use a valid combo of username and NTLM hash rather than plaintext password.  password hashes aren't salted and remain static between sessions, including being valid for the same account on a different system.

tool must support auth via hash
* smb enumeration and management
	* smbclient
	* CrackMapExec
* command execution
	* impacket

we can also access the system via SMB, RDP, and WinRM with proper rights.

`smbclient \\\\192.168.50.212\\secrets -U Administrator --pw-nt-hash 7a38310ea6f0027ee955abed1762964b`

We can use the _impacket-scripts_[9](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/password-attacks-44959/working-with-password-hashes-45019/passing-ntlm-44966#fn-local_id_50-9) package to execute **psexec.py** on Kali. This package contains links to the example scripts of the impacket library and provides a user-friendly way to use them.

To execute _psexec_, we can enter **impacket-psexec** with two arguments. The first argument is **-hashes**, which allows us to use NTLM hashes to authenticate to the target. The format is "LMHash:NTHash", in which we specify the Administrator NTLM hash after the colon. Since we only use the NTLM hash, we can fill the LMHash section with 32 0's.

The second argument is the target definition in the format "username@ip".
`impacket-psexec -hashes 00000000000000000000000000000000:7a38310ea6f0027ee955abed1762964b Administrator@192.168.50.212`
**psexec.py will always give us a SYSTEM shell instead of the user authenticated as**
wmiexec.py will give a shell as the authenticated user
