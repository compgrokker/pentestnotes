Windows specialized exploitation and post-exploitation framework.  Other OS tools available in Empire, but mostly good for Windows.

C&C server

modules include keylogger and Mimikatz

starkiller is GUI frontend

`sudo powershell-empire server` server must be running to use client

`sudo powershell-empire client` starts client and connects to server

client is an interactive console like msfconsole

`listeners` to list current listeners
`agents` to list current agents

default creds for starkiller empireadmin:password123

listeners are simple listeners
stagers are executables to send to target system
agents are target systems that have been exploited

- set up listener
- once it's listed in listeners page, set up stager
- set listener to set up listener
- download stager and get it over to target system
`sudo python3 -m http.server 80`
- agent call-back will show up in Agents when stager code has been downloaded and executed

clicking on agent name in Agents allows you to interact with target via starkiller gui

`interact <agent>` in console to interact with target in Empire client

not realtime interaction like meterpreter (prepare for lag)

used by red teamers for long-term engagements
